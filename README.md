## Error Codes

When making requests to the Audibert API, you may encounter these error codes. Use these codes to understand and handle errors in your application appropriately.

| Code | Description                               |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 404  | Resource not found (route, user or guild) |
| 500  | Internal server error                     |

## Note

Some activity images may not be returned correctly. This is a limitation of Discord, as the activity the user is playing may not have direct configuration for rich presence on Discord. In such cases, a default image will be returned: ![Default Image](https://ibb.co/yF7QFQY6)

Some apps with this problem were alredy fixed in the code, by proving a image for them:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  VALORANT: {
    largeImage: "https://cdn.discordapp.com/app-icons/700136079562375258/e55fc8259df1548328f977d302779ab7.png",
  },
  Roblox: {
    largeImage: "https://cdn.discordapp.com/app-icons/363445589247131668/f2b60e350a2097289b3b0b877495e55f.png",
  },
  Fortnite: {
    largeImage: "https://cdn.discordapp.com/app-icons/432980957394370572/c1864b38910c209afd5bf6423b672022.png",
  }
